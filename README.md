# AudioDVP

This is the official implementation of **Photorealistic Audio-driven Video Portraits**.


## Major Requirements

* Ubuntu >= 18.04
* PyTorch >= 1.2
* GCC >= 7.5
* NVCC >= 10.1
* FFmpeg (with H.264 support)


FYI, detailed environment setup is in enviroment.yml.


## Major implementation differences against original paper

* Geometry parameter and texture parameter of 3DMM is now initialized from zero and shared among all samples during fitting, since it is more reasonable.

* Using OpenCV rather than PIL for image editing operation.


## Usage

### 1. Download face model data

* Download **Basel Face Model 2009** from https://faces.dmi.unibas.ch/bfm/main.php.
* Download **expression basis** from https://github.com/Juyong/3DFace.

* Put the data in `renderer/data` like the structure below.

    ```
    renderer/data
    ├── 01_MorphableModel.mat
    ├── BFM_exp_idx.mat
    ├── BFM_front_idx.mat
    ├── Exp_Pca.bin
    ├── facemodel_info.mat
    ├── select_vertex_id.mat
    ├── std_exp.txt
    └── data.mat(This is generated by the step 2 below.)
    ```

### 2. Build data

```zsh
cd renderer/
python build_data.py
```

### 3.Download pretrained model of ATnet
* The link is https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WYhqKBFX6mLtdJ8sYVLdWUqp5FJDmphg.
* Put `atnet_lstm_18.pth` in `vendor/ATVGnet/model`.

### 4.Download pretrained ResNet on VGGFace2
* The link is https://drive.google.com/open?id=1A94PAAnwk6L7hXdBXLFosB_s0SzEhAFU.
* Put `resnet50_ft_weight.pkl` in `weights`

### 5.Download Trump speech video
* The link is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a1Mdq8-_wo. (Video courtesy of The White House.)
* Put it in `data/video`

### 6.Compile CUDA rasterizer kernel

```zsh
cd renderer/kernels
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```


### 7.Running demo script

```zsh
# Explanation of every step is provided.
./scripts/demo.sh
```


Since we provide both training and inference code, we won't upload pretrained model for brevity at present.
We provide expected result in `data/sample_result.mp4` using synthesized audio in `data/test_audio`.
